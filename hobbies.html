                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>I love reading at my leaisure. I have read nearly 25 non academic novels till date which includes stand-alones as well as series. My favourite series include Harry Potter by J.K Rowling and A good girl's Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson.</p>

                <h2>Painting</h2>
                <p>Painting is my heart and soul and I might as well be just a limp without emotional and intelligent functionalities without it. I have taken a proper course of painting and am one year away from completing it. I have been in practice for the past 15 years and I now make commissioned ones as well.</p>

                <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>I like to write poems, small pieces of prose and couplets. I thorougly enjoy poetry , especially in urdu and hindi. And ofcourse, my favourite poet has to be Gulzar. That man knows exactly how powerful words can get!</p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>Photographs aren't just colourful results of simple optical experiment through an apparatus called camers, they're everything more than that. For me photographs are more special rather than just pictures, and hence , photography. I like capturing moments, storing them and looking back at them years later to realise how time has flown by and be grateful for each moment I get.</p>
